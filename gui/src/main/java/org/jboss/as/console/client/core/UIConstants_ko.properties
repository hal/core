This would typically be the same as 'name', but in some cases users may wish to have two deployments with the same 'runtime-name' (e.g. two versions of 'foo.war') both available in the deployment content repository, in which case the deployments would need to have distinct 'name' values but would have the same 'runtime-name'.

interfacesDescription=A logical name for a network interface/IP address/host name to which sockets can be bound. The domain.xml, host.xml and standalone.xml configurations all include a section where interfaces can be declared. Other sections of the configuration can then reference those interfaces by their logical name, rather than having to include the full details of the interface (which may vary on different machines). An interface configuration includes the logical name of the interface as well as information specifying the criteria to use for resolving the actual physical address to use. See Interfaces and ports for further details.

subsystemsDescription=A set of subsystem configurations. A subsystem is an added set of capabilities added to the core server by an extension. A subsystem provides servlet handling capabilities; a subsystem provides an EJB container; a subsystem provides JTA, etc. A profile is a named list of subsystems, along with the details of each subsystem's configuration. A profile with a large number of subsystems results in a server with a large set of capabilities. A profile with a small, focused set of subsystems will have fewer capabilities but a smaller footprint.
